# Next.js - Chakra UI Starter project (TypeScript)

This is the a quick starter project using [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app with TypeScript.

Next.js and chakra-ui have built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for their modules straight away.

We are connecting the Next.js `_app.js` with `chakra-ui`'s Provider and theme so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.

We've also create a basic layout including really simple header and footer.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

And then go to localhost:3000.
